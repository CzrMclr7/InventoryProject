     Possible data issues
       The type for column ModuleId in table [dbo].[UserAccess] is currently  NCHAR (10) NULL but is being changed to  INT NOT
         NULL. Data loss could occur and deployment may fail if the column contains data that is incompatible with type  INT NOT
         NULL.

** Supporting actions

The column ModuleId on table [dbo].[UserAccess] must be changed from NULL to NOT NULL. If the table contains data, the ALTER script may not work. To avoid this issue, you must add values to this column for all rows or mark it as allowing NULL values, or enable the generation of smart-defaults as a deployment option.
